 * <p>======================= OrgPolicyClient =======================
 *
 * <p>Service Description: An interface for managing organization policies.
 *
 * <p>The Cloud Org Policy service provides a simple mechanism for organizations to restrict the
 * allowed configurations across their entire Cloud Resource hierarchy.
 *
 * <p>You can use a `policy` to configure restrictions in Cloud resources. For example, you can
 * enforce a `policy` that restricts which Google Cloud Platform APIs can be activated in a certain
 * part of your resource hierarchy, or prevents serial port access to VM instances in a particular
 * folder.
 *
 * <p>`Policies` are inherited down through the resource hierarchy. A `policy` applied to a parent
 * resource automatically applies to all its child resources unless overridden with a `policy` lower
 * in the hierarchy.
 *
 * <p>A `constraint` defines an aspect of a resource's configuration that can be controlled by an
 * organization's policy administrator. `Policies` are a collection of `constraints` that defines
 * their allowable configuration on a particular resource and its child resources.
 *
 * <p>Sample for OrgPolicyClient:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * try (OrgPolicyClient orgPolicyClient = OrgPolicyClient.create()) {
 *   PolicyName name = PolicyName.ofProjectPolicyName("[PROJECT]", "[POLICY]");
 *   Policy response = orgPolicyClient.getPolicy(name);
 * }
 * }</pre>
